# Set theory

## Standard set-theoretic notation
- ∅ denotes the empty set
- x ∈ A means that x is an element, or member, of the set A; 
- For two sets A,B, A ⊆ B means that A is a subset of B (with A possibly equal to B), and A ( B means that A is a
proper subset of B (i.e., A ⊆ B but A 6= B). Further, A ∪ B denotes the union of
A and B, A ∩ B the intersection of A and B, and A \ B the set of all elements of
A that are not in B. If A is a set with a finite number of elements, then we write
|A| for its size, or cardinality. We use standard notation for describing sets; for
example, if we define the set S := {−2,−1, 0, 1, 2}, then {x
2
: x ∈ S} = {0, 1, 4}
and {x ∈ S : x is even} = {−2, 0, 2}.
We write S1 × · · · × Sn for the Cartesian product of sets S1, . . . , Sn, which is
the set of all n-tuples (a1, . . . , an), where ai ∈ Si for i = 1, . . . , n. We write S
×n
for
the Cartesian product of n copies of a set S, and for x ∈ S, we write x
×n
for the
element of S
×n
consisting of n copies of x. (This notation is a bit non-standard,
but we reserve the more standard notation S
n
for other purposes, so as to avoid
ambiguity.)
